# NYC

The static single-page website I have implemented consists of three (3) blog posts about the World Cup, NYC Destinations, and Mac Laptops. The website is a two column structure consisting of the following sections: Header, Main, Nav, and Footer. 

Instructions:

**You must have the appropriate downloads for working environment and development server. React JS, babel, NodeJS, NPM, and webpack are required. Here is a setup Link: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/reactjs_environment_setup.htm

1) create working folder and save my source code in the folder along with the environment and development server files 
2) open command prompt terminal 
3) enter command "npm start" to deploy my static website in the browser (ensure the terminal is operating from the working folder of the application)
